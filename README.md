## Unity Solomons Key like Block placing Mechanic

This is a unity project presenting a basic character controller with a "magic stick" attached as a child object and a "block dispenser". The block dispensers is in charge of instantiating the blocks in the correct position. All the sprites are set to 128 px per unit so I can easily place the tiles at absolute positions. If the block dispenser is at x=1.34 y=1.46 the dispenser rounds up to 1,1 and places the object in that position.

### Controllers:
- Left Arrow to go left
- Right arrow to go right
- Up arrow to jump
- Space to place blocks
